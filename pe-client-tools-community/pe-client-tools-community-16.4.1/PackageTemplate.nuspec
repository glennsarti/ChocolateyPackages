    <description><![CDATA[ The Puppet Enterprise client tools is a set of command line tools that let you access Puppet Enterprise services from a workstation that
may or may not be managed by Puppet.

NOTE - This is a community chocolatey package for the Puppet Development Kit.  This package is not owned or maintained by Puppet.  It is merely here as a stop-gap measure until Puppet release an official package.

Because you can safely run these tools remotely, you no longer need to SSH into the Puppet master to execute commands. Your permissions to see information and to take action are controlled by PE role-based access control (RBAC). Your activity is logged under your username rather than under root or the pe-puppet user.
