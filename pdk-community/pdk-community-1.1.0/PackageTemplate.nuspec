    <description><![CDATA[ Puppet Development Kit (PDK) is a package of development and testing tools to help you create great Puppet modules.

NOTE - This is a community chocolatey package for the Puppet Development Kit.  This package is not owned or maintained by Puppet.  It is merely here as a stop-gap measure until Puppet release an official package.

PDK includes key Puppet code development and testing tools for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X workstations, so you can install one package with the tools you need to create and validate new modules. PDK includes testing tools, a complete module skeleton, and command line tools to help you create, validate, and run tests on Puppet modules. PDK also includes all dependencies needed for its use.

You can also convert existing modules to make them compatible with PDK. This allows you to use all of the creation, validation, and testing tools in PDK with the converted module.
